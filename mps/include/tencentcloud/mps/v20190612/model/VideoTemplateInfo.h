                     * Fill type. "Fill" refers to the way of processing a screenshot when its aspect ratio is different from that of the source video. The following fill types are supported:
<li> stretch: Stretch. The screenshot will be stretched frame by frame to match the aspect ratio of the source video, which may make the screenshot "shorter" or "longer";</li>
<li>black: Fill with black. This option retains the aspect ratio of the source video for the screenshot and fills the unmatched area with black color blocks.</li>
Default value: black.
